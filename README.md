## About

The Holberton ML Handbook is a practical, project-based curriculum covering the essential skills for machine learning development. Built around clear tutorials, real code examples, and progressive exercises, this handbook guides learners from development environment setup through core ML algorithms and deployment.

**Live Documentation:** [https://evisp.github.io/ml-handbook/](https://evisp.github.io/ml-handbook/)

## What's Inside

- **Tools:** Development environment setup with Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, and Python fundamentals
- **Math:** Linear algebra, NumPy, calculus, and probability/statistics foundations for ML
- **Data:** Data collection, cleaning, visualization, and querying with pandas, SQL, and MongoDB
- **Core ML:** The ML lifecycle, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning algorithms
- New exciting modules will come up soon covering Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Model Training and Optimization, Generative AI, Data Engineering and so much more

## Getting Started
