# Tools Overview

This section introduces essential tools for effective machine learning practice. Each tool supports foundational workflows from code management and experimentation to development environment setup.

## Git and GitHub

Git is the standard version control system that enables tracking code changes and collaborating across teams. 

GitHub builds on Git by providing a cloud platform to host repositories, review code, manage issues, and streamline collaboration. 

## Jupyter Notebook Setup

Jupyter notebooks offer an interactive environment for writing and running live code, visualizing data, and documenting analysis in one document. Setting up Jupyter notebooks properly supports exploratory data analysis, prototyping machine learning models, and communicating results effectively.

## VS Code Setup

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, lightweight code editor favored for its extensibility and integrated development environment features. Configuring VS Code with Python, Git, and notebook extensions equips you with a productive workspace for writing, debugging, and versioning ML code.
