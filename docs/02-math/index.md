## [Linear algebra](linear-algebra.md)

**The language of data and models**

Understand vectors, matrices, and transformations—the backbone of features, embeddings, and neural networks. Learn the operations that show up everywhere: dot products, norms, matrix multiplication, and projections.

**You’ll learn:** How data is represented, how models combine inputs, and how to work with matrices confidently

## [Calculus](./calculus.md)

**Change, slopes, and optimization**

Grasp derivatives, gradients, and chain rule to see how models learn. Connect loss functions to gradient descent and learn why step size and curvature matter.

**You’ll learn:** How to compute and interpret gradients, tune learning, and reason about optimization

## [Probability & Statistics](probability-statistics.md)

**Uncertainty, inference, and decisions**

Work with distributions, sampling, estimation, and confidence. Learn how to evaluate models with sound metrics and understand variance, bias, and overfitting.

**You’ll learn:** How to quantify uncertainty, choose the right metrics, and make data‑driven decisions

**Start here:** Pick one topic, do a quick review, then try a small exercise in code. Repeat often—clarity compounds.
