## [Data Fundamentals](./data-foundations.md)

**Understanding the data pipeline**

Learn why data quality determines ML success and master the six-phase pipeline: collection, exploration, cleaning, transformation, splitting, and storage.

**You'll learn:** Data types, quality dimensions, common challenges (imbalanced, missing, drift), and best practices for reproducible workflows


## [Pandas](./pandas.md)
**Load, explore, and reshape data fast**

Read files, select rows/columns, filter, group, merge, and tidy your datasets so analysis feels smooth, not painful.

**You’ll learn:** Importing data, cleaning columns, joins, groupby, and quick summaries

## [Visualization](./visualization.md)

**Make patterns visible**

Tell a clear story with plots that highlight trends, comparisons, and outliers using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**You’ll learn:** Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, line charts, and choosing the right chart for the question

## [Data Processing](./data-processing.md)

**From messy to usable**

Handle missing values, fix types, engineer features, and prepare datasets that models can learn from.

**You’ll learn:** Imputation, encoding, scaling, datetime handling, and feature creation

## [Data collection](./data-collection.md)

**Get the data you need**

Pull data from files, APIs, and the web—then store it in formats that are easy to use and share.

**You’ll learn:** CSV/Parquet basics, calling APIs, simple scraping, and organizing raw vs. processed data

## [SQL databases](./sql.md)

**Query data with confidence**

Use SQL to select, join, aggregate, and filter data directly where it lives—fast and reproducible.

**You’ll learn:** SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and writing queries for analysis

## [NoSQL (MongoDB)](./mongo.md)

**Work with flexible data**

Store and query JSON‑like documents for logs, events, and semi‑structured sources common in ML workflows.

**You’ll learn:** Inserting documents, filtering with queries, projections, and basic aggregations

Start with a small dataset, answer one question with a plot, then clean and shape the data for a simple model. Repeat—each pass makes the story (and the model) sharper.
