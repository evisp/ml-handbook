## [Introduction to Machine Learning](./ml-intro.md)
**What ML is and when to use it**

Understand the difference between ML, AI, and Deep Learning. Learn when ML makes sense and when traditional programming is better. Preview the full workflow before diving into algorithms.

**You'll learn:** ML definitions, real-world applications, when to use ML, prerequisites check

## [ML Lifecycle](./lifecycle.md)
**From problem to production**

See the complete journey: define the problem, collect and prepare data, train models, evaluate with proper metrics, deploy, and monitor. Learn to iterate—measure, improve, repeat.

**You'll learn:** Problem framing, data preparation, experiment tracking, model evaluation, deployment basics, monitoring

## [Regression](./regression.md)
**Predict continuous values**

Master Linear Regression from the ground up. Understand cost functions, training processes, and evaluation metrics. Learn to spot and fix overfitting.

**You'll learn:** Linear regression, polynomial regression, cost functions (MSE), R², RMSE, MAE, bias-variance tradeoff

## [Classification](./supervised.md)
**Predict categories**

Build classifiers that generalize. From Logistic Regression to Decision Trees and Random Forests. Master evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.

**You'll learn:** Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC

## [Supervised Advanced](./supervised-advanced.md)
**Expand your toolkit**

Add KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM to your arsenal. Compare algorithms and learn when to use each. Build intuition for model selection.

**You'll learn:** k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, algorithm comparison, model selection

## [Unsupervised Learning](./unsupervised.md)
**Find patterns without labels**

Discover hidden structure in data. Cluster similar items and compress features while keeping signal. Master evaluation without ground truth.

**You'll learn:** K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, dimensionality reduction, evaluation strategies


> Start simple, measure honestly, and improve in small steps. A clear baseline plus good metrics beats fancy algorithms every time.
