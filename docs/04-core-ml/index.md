# Core ML Overview

Build solid ML skills step by step. Clear goals, small projects, and habits that make models reliable in the real world.

## [ML Lifecycle](./lifecycle.md)
**From idea to impact**

See the full journey: define the problem, prepare data, build a baseline, evaluate with the right metrics, deploy, and monitor. Learn to loop—measure, improve, and repeat.

**You’ll learn:** Framing problems, setting metrics, experiment tracking, deployment basics, and monitoring

## [Model foundations](./classical-ml.md)

**The classics that still win**

Master the workhorses: linear/logistic regression, trees, ensembles, and k‑NN. Understand bias–variance, regularization, cross‑validation, and when simple beats complex.

**You’ll learn:** Baselines, feature–target fit, regularization, cross‑validation, and strong starter models

## [Supervised learning](./supervised.md)

**Predict with labels**

Build classifiers and regressors that generalize. Compare models, tune hyperparameters, and read learning curves to avoid overfitting.

**You’ll learn:** Pipelines, metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC‑AUC, MAE/RMSE), hyperparameter search, and model selection

## [Unsupervised learning](./unsupervised.md)

**Find structure without labels**

Discover patterns and reduce noise. Cluster similar items and compress features while keeping signal.

**You’ll learn:** k‑means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, t‑SNE/UMAP basics, and evaluation without labels

***

Start simple, measure honestly, and improve in small steps. A clear baseline plus good metrics will take most projects farther than fancy tricks.
