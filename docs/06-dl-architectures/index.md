## [Convolutions and Pooling](./convolutions-pooling.md)
**Teach models to "see" edges and shapes**

Convolutions slide over pixels to find patterns automatically. Your project uses these exact operations.

**You'll learn:** How filters detect edges/textures, stride/padding control, pooling to focus on important areas

## [Convolutional Neural Networks](./cnns.md)
**Complete image classifiers from scratch**

Stack conv → pool → dense layers into working CNNs. See your classification project come alive.

**You'll learn:** Full CNN pipeline, feature extraction step-by-step, why CNNs beat regular networks for images

## [Data Augmentation](./data-augmentation.md)
**Turn 100 photos into 10,000 training examples**

Flip, rotate, zoom - make models ready for the real world. Instant accuracy boost for your CNN project.

**You'll learn:** Smart transforms that preserve labels, augmentation pipelines, balancing strength

## [Deep Convolutional Architectures](./deep-cnns.md)
**Scale to 100M+ parameter vision models**

ResNet connections + VGG blocks = production CNNs. Build the deep networks from your project.

**You'll learn:** Residual blocks that train deep, depth vs width, modern ImageNet winners

## [Transfer Learning](./transfer-learning.md)
**Borrow years of training in 5 minutes**

Start with ImageNet-pretrained models. Fine-tune for your data - the smart way to build vision apps.

**You'll learn:** Freeze/extract/fine-tune strategies, avoiding common transfer pitfalls

## [Object Detection](./object-detection.md)
**Draw boxes around every object**

Find *where* AND *what* is in images. Your project's anchors + NMS = production object detection.

**You'll learn:** Bounding boxes, IoU matching, non-max suppression, mAP evaluation

> **Real vision systems = CNN engineering.** Right data + architecture + validation = models that work on your phone camera tomorrow.
