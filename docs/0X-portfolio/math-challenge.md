# ML Math Challenge - Competition Overview

## Objective

This friendly competition is designed to help you **review and connect key math concepts** that form the foundation of Machine Learning (`Linear Algebra`, `Calculus`, and `Probability`.)

You’ll work in teams to solve short, intuitive challenges.
No coding (maybe only *vibe* coding) or long calculations; just reasoning, teamwork, and quick thinking.


## Teams

* You’ll work in teams. Discuss ideas together before answering.
* One team member will share the final answer for each question or task.
* **Each team member must present at least one task**

## Competition Flow

There are **four rounds**, each focusing on a different skill area.
Each round includes a few short questions or mini tasks.
Points are earned for correct answers, reasoning, and teamwork.

### Round 1 – True or False Showdown

- This round will include quick statements from all topics.
- Points double for each correct answer (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16),
but one wrong answer resets your score to `0`
- Speed and accuracy matter.

**Review ideas:**

* Basic matrix and vector properties
* Derivatives and slopes
* Probability and independence
* General math logic and intuition


### Round 2 – Linear Algebra Concepts

Focus on how data can be represented and transformed using matrices and vectors.
You'll reason about relationships between features, combinations, and transformations.

**Review ideas:**

* Matrices, vectors, and dimensions
* Matrix × vector multiplication
* Linear combinations and feature meaning
* Projections and geometric interpretation

### Round 3 – Calculus and Optimization

Explore how change, slope, and direction affect learning.
You’ll think about how models improve by adjusting parameters.

**Review ideas:**

* Derivative as rate of change
* Gradient and direction of improvement
* Learning rate intuition
* Local minima and convergence


### Round 4 – Probability and Statistics

Work with small data samples to understand patterns and uncertainty.
Expect reasoning around averages, variation, and data interpretation.

**Review ideas:**

* Mean, median, mode
* Variance and standard deviation
* Distributions and outliers
* Interpreting data intuitively


## Scoring

* Points for correct answers and strong reasoning.
* Some rounds may include bonus points for clear explanations or teamwork.
* The team with the highest total score wins!


## Tips for Success

* Think out loud and explain your reasoning.
* Focus on intuition, not memorization.
* Work together efficiently, share ideas quickly.
* Stay relaxed and enjoy the process, learning through play is the goal!
