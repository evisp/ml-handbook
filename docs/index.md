# Holberton ML Handbook (Albania)

A practical, curated handbook for a 9‑month journey from foundations to modern machine learning and deep learning. It emphasizes hands-on skills, conceptual clarity, and links to high-quality resources.

## How to use this handbook

- Navigate with the left sidebar to browse sections and lessons.  
- Start at the top and move down for a structured path, or jump directly to a topic when needed.  
- Each page includes explanations, short tutorials, code examples, and links for deeper study.  

## Who this is for

- Learners in the Holberton School Albania ML training.  
- Self-driven readers with basic Python, command-line, and Git familiarity.  
- Anyone seeking a concise, well-organized ML knowledge base.

## Quick start

## Learning path (suggested)

- Foundations first: Tools → Math → Data.  
- Practice with mini-projects as concepts appear.  
- Build toward Core ML and then Deep Learning.  
- Conclude with a capstone and deployment.

## Study tips

- Keep notes and summaries for each lesson.  
- Reproduce examples, then modify them to test understanding.  
- Teach a peer: explaining reinforces learning.
